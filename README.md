# Crack-Detection
This project demonstrates an advanced approach to crack detection in images using transfer learning. Leveraging pre-trained deep learning models, this solution fine-tunes a network to accurately identify and classify cracks in various surfaces. The key steps in this project include:

Data Preparation: Processed a dataset of images with annotated cracks.
Model Selection: Utilized transfer learning by adapting ResNet to the crack detection task.
Training and Evaluation: Fine-tuned the model on the prepared dataset and evaluated its performance using standard metrics.
