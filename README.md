# Crack-Detection
This project demonstrates an advanced approach to crack detection in images using transfer learning. Leveraging pre-trained deep learning models, this solution fine-tunes a network to accurately identify and classify cracks in various surfaces. The key steps in this project include:

<ul>
  <li>Data Preparation: Processed a dataset of images with annotated cracks.</li>
  <li>Model Selection: Utilized transfer learning by adapting ResNet to the crack detection task.</li>
  <li>Training and Evaluation: Fine-tuned the model on the prepared dataset and evaluated its performance using standard metrics.</li></ul>
